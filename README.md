ISIMOTOR2 AI GUIDE ðŸ“˜
---
*A Complete Guide to ajust the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in racing simulators based on the ISIMOTOR2 engine.*

---
**A guide I created with everything I learned over three years of forum research and game testing.**
This document was created with the objective of centralizing and explaining all the variables that affect the behavior of AI in titles such as:
- rFactor 1
- GTR2
- Race 07
- F1 Challenge 99-02
- Automobilista 1

---
The guide includes detailed explanations on:
- PLR, HDV, TBC, RCD, AIW and GDB files
- AI behavior, bugs and improvements
- Practical examples, formulas and recommendations
- Adjustments per game and differences between engines
- Custom setup and calibration for AI

I hope it helps you improve your AI experience in any Isimotor game (except RF2, which has a different AI).
